# `zod.mge.tf` Reloaded 
### ⚠️ not live on my server(s) right now ⚠️
This is a _concept_ repository where, if I ever get the free time, I'll hopefully be able to work from sappho's absurdly well-made server setup into a much less well-made version that is perfectly tailored for my use. For now, the current servers run an ***EXTREMELY*** poorly made system, which is likely the way it will stay for a while.

## Credit
Full credit to [sappho](https://github.com/sapphonie) for the _extensive_ work put into this codebase. It is incredibly generous of her to share her setup so transparently and allow people like me to try and utilize it as if we know what we're doing.
